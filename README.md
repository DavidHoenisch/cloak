# 🚨 Cloak: Securely Wrap Your Secrets! 🕵️‍♂️

**Cloak** is your go-to CLI tool for keeping sensitive environment variables (like API keys) under wraps, exposing them *only* to the apps you trust. Built with 💪 Go, it’s lightning-fast, secure, and perfect for developers juggling secrets in shared environments. Say goodbye to leaky env vars and hello to streamlined, secure workflows! 🎉

## 🌟 Why Cloak?

Ever worried about apps snooping on your API keys stored in environment variables? 😱 **Cloak** solves this by letting you group secrets (e.g., `aws-prod`) in a config file and inject them *only* into the CLI tool you’re running. It’s like a secret agent ensuring your sensitive data stays classified! 🕶️

- **Secure**: Limits env var exposure to just the target app. 🔒
- **Flexible**: Reads secrets from a JSON config file (with plans for secrets manager support). 📝
- **Simple**: Wraps your CLI tools with a single command. 🚀
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built in Go for speed and reliability. ⚡

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloak.git
   ```
2. Build and install:
   ```bash
   cd cloak
   go build
   go install
   ```
3. Run `cloak --help` to see available commands! 🖥️

## 📚 Usage

**Cloak** organizes your secrets into groups, letting you run CLI tools with just the env vars they need. Here’s how it works:

### 1. Initialize a Config File
Create a default JSON config file (`~/.config/cloak/conf.json`):
```bash
cloak config init
```
This generates an example config with a group like:
```json
{
  "name": "Example Config File Name",
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "ExampleGroup",
      "vars": [
        { "key": "AnthropicAPIKey", "value": "some-random-string" },
        { "key": "OpenAIApiKey", "value": "some-random-string" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Use `--force` to overwrite an existing config:
```bash
cloak config init --force
```

### 2. List Configured Groups
Check which groups are defined in your config:
```bash
cloak config list-groups
```

### 3. Validate Your Config
Ensure your config file is valid:
```bash
cloak config validate
```

### 4. Run a CLI Tool with a Group
Run a tool with a specific group’s env vars (not fully implemented yet, but here’s the vision):
```bash
cloak aws-prod aws-cli s3 ls
```
This sets `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (from the `aws-prod` group) only for `aws-cli s3 ls`.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

**Cloak** is in early development! Current features include config initialization, group listing, and validation. Upcoming features:
- Running CLI tools with group-specific env vars. 🛠️
- Support for secrets managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault). 🌐
- Enhanced validation and error handling. ✅
